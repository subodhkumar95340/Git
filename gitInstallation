#First, use the apt package management tools to update your local package index.
sudo apt update
#With the update complete, you can install Git:
sudo apt install git
#check git version
git --version
#Configuration can be achieved by using the git config command. Specifically, we need to provide our name and email address because Git embeds this information into each commit we do. We can go ahead and add this information by typing:
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@domain.com"
#We can display all of the configuration items that have been set by typing:
git config --list
#The information you enter is stored in your Git configuration file, which you can optionally edit by hand with a text editor of your choice like this (weâ€™ll use nano):cat ~/.gitconfig

#In the terminal, type:
mkdir Demo
#Change your terminal to the Demo directory with the command:
cd Demo
#Then enter:
echo "#Demo" >> README.md
cat README.md


#To tell your computer that Demo is a directory managed by the Git program, enter:
git init
#Then, to tell the Git program you care about this file and want to track any changes from this point forward, enter:
git add README.md
#To make a commit, enter:
git commit -m "first commit"
#Now, it's time to connect your computer to GitHub with the command:
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your_username>/Demo.git
